# DataScience-MajorMinor-Projects

This repository contains two complete Data Science projects — one **Major Project** and one **Minor Project** — implemented using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and other data science libraries.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Major Project: Loan Default Prediction & Analysis
**Dataset:** [Loan Default Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default)  
**Description:**  
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of loan defaults using machine learning and performing deep exploratory data analysis. It includes:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Machine learning model building & evaluation  
- Plot folder with key insights screenshots

📂 **Files & Folders:**
- `Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb` – Main code file  
- `plots/` – Generated plots and graphs  
- `screenshots/` – Screenshots of analysis  
- `dataset_link.txt` – Dataset source
